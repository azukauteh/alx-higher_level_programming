# 0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle

This directory contains Python programs written for ALX_africa Software Engineering, 0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle project. The code in this project focuses on object-oriented programming concepts in Python, with a specific emphasis on classes, inheritance, and data encapsulation.

## Files

### models/base.py
The `base.py` file contains the implementation of the `Base` class, which serves as the base class for other classes in the project. It includes common attributes and methods that are inherited by the derived classes.

### models/__init__.py
The `__init__.py` file is an empty file that is required to make the `models` directory a Python package. It allows the Python interpreter to recognize the `models` directory as a module and enables the importing of modules from within the package.

## Usage
To use the classes and functionalities implemented in this project, you can import the necessary modules or classes into your Python script. For example:

```python
from models.base import Base

# Create an instance of the Base class
base_instance = Base()

# Use methods or access attributes of the base_instance
```

Make sure to have the relevant files (`base.py` and `__init__.py`) in your working directory or in a location that can be accessed by your Python script.
