## Description

This derectory contains Python exercises and examples related to Input/Output (I/O) operations. It covers various concepts and techniques for working with input and output in Python.

Topics covered in this repository include:

- Reading and writing files
- File modes and file objects
- File handling operations
- Standard input/output
- Command-line arguments
- Error handling and exception handling
- Context managers and the `with` statement
- Serialization and deserialization (using `pickle` and `json`)
- Working with CSV files
- Working with binary files
- Directory and file manipulation
- Standard input/output redirection

Each topic is accompanied by examples and exercises to reinforce your understanding of the concepts.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x0B-python-input_output.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd 0x0B-python-input_output
   ```

3. Explore the files and directories to find the relevant Python scripts and examples for each topic.

4. To run a specific script or example, use the `python` command followed by the script name. For example:

   ```bash
   $ python read_file.py
   ```

   This will execute the `read_file.py` script and display the output, if any.

5. Complete the exercises provided within the repository to practice and improve your understanding of Python's input/output operations.
