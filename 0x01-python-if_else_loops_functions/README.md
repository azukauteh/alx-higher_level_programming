#0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

![Author](https://img.shields.io/badge/Author-AzukaUteh-blue.svg)


This directory contains code and documentation for the "0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions" project as part of the ALX - Software Engineering curriculum.

## Description

The "0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions" project introduces various control structures in Python, including if/else statements, loops (while and for loops), and functions. It covers the usage and syntax of these constructs and provides practice exercises to reinforce the concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn:

- How to use conditional statements (if/else) to make decisions in Python.
- The concept of loops and how to use while and for loops for repetitive tasks.
- How to define and use functions to modularize code and improve reusability.
- Common Python built-in functions and their applications.
- How to create and use custom functions to perform specific tasks.
- The difference between arguments and parameters in function definitions.
- Best practices for code readability and organization.

## Repository Contents

The project repository contains the following files:

- `0-positive_or_negative.py`: A Python script that generates a random number and determines if it is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.py`: A Python script that generates a random number and determines its last digit's significance.
- `2-print_alphabet.py`: A Python script that prints the lowercase alphabet using a loop.
- `3-print_alphabt.py`: A Python script that prints the lowercase alphabet except for 'q' and 'e' using a loop and conditional statement.
- `4-print_hexa.py`: A Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal representation.
- `5-print_comb2.py`: A Python script that prints pairs of two-digit numbers using a loop.
- `6-print_comb3.py`: A Python script that prints combinations of three-digit numbers that are unique using nested loops.
- `100-print_tebahpla.py`: A Python script that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order and alternating cases using a loop and string slicing.
- `101-remove_char_at.py`: A Python script that removes a character from a string at a specific position.
- `102-magic_calculation.py`: A Python function that replicates the bytecode of a given Python code snippet.

## Requirements

#Python Scripts

All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)

All your files should end with a new line

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

All your files must be executable

The length of your files will be tested using wc

# C Scripts

## How to Use

To use any of the scripts or functions in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/azukauteh/alx-higher_level_programming
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd 0x01-python-if_else_loops
```

3. Run any script or function using Python:

```
python3 script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script or function you want to execute.
