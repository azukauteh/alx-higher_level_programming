## Introduction

In this directory, you will find Python scripts and exercises that cover the basics of networking and network programming. The goal is to understand key networking concepts and how to implement them using Python. This includes working with sockets, protocols, network communication, and more.

## Requirements

To work with the scripts and exercises in this directory, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system. 
- Familiarity with networking concepts (TCP/IP, sockets, protocols, etc.).
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- You must use get to access to dictionary value by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method 
- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using if __name__ == "__main__":)

## Getting Started
