# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

This directory contains exercises and examples related to Python classes and objects. In this module, you will learn about the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python and how to create and use classes and objects.

## Getting Started

It is recommended to have a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and running Python code. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

## Requirement

# Python Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)

All your files should end with a new line

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

All your files must be executable

The length of your files will be tested using wc

# C Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

## Key Concepts

The main concepts covered in this module include:

- **Classes:** Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming. They define the structure and behavior of objects. You will learn how to create classes, define attributes and methods, and instantiate objects from classes.

- **Objects:** Objects are instances of classes. They represent specific entities with their own state and behavior. You will learn how to create objects and interact with their attributes and methods.

- **Attributes:** Attributes are variables associated with a class or object. They store data related to the class or object. You will learn about instance attributes (specific to an object) and class attributes (shared among all objects of a class).

- **Methods:** Methods are functions defined within a class. They define the behavior and actions that objects of the class can perform. You will learn about instance methods, class methods, and static methods.

- **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. It promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

- **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they adhere to a common interface or inherit from a common base class.

- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods within a class. It hides the internal implementation details and provides controlled access to the object's attributes and methods.

## Directory Structure

```

- The `examples` directory contains Python files that demonstrate various concepts related to classes and objects. These examples serve as a reference to understand the concepts and their implementation.

- The `exercises` directory contains Python files with exercise prompts. Each exercise focuses on a specific topic or concept related to classes and objects. You can solve the exercises to practice and reinforce your understanding.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.

2. Navigate to the repository's directory.

3. Explore the `examples` directory to study the provided code examples and gain a better understanding of the concepts.

4. Solve the exercises in the `exercises` directory. Each exercise file contains a prompt and placeholders for your code. Replace the placeholders with your solutions.

5. Test your solutions by running the exercise files using Python. You can execute the command `python3 exercise1.py` (replace `exercise1.py` with the exercise file you want to run).

6. Repeat steps 4-5 for each exercise in the `exercises` directory .
