# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

This directory contains exercises and examples related to Python classes and objects. In this module, you will learn about the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python and how to create and use classes and objects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this module, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

It is recommended to have a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and running Python code. Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Atom.

## Key Concepts

The main concepts covered in this module include:

- **Classes:** Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming. They define the structure and behavior of objects. You will learn how to create classes, define attributes and methods, and instantiate objects from classes.

- **Objects:** Objects are instances of classes. They represent specific entities with their own state and behavior. You will learn how to create objects and interact with their attributes and methods.

- **Attributes:** Attributes are variables associated with a class or object. They store data related to the class or object. You will learn about instance attributes (specific to an object) and class attributes (shared among all objects of a class).

- **Methods:** Methods are functions defined within a class. They define the behavior and actions that objects of the class can perform. You will learn about instance methods, class methods, and static methods.

- **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. It promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

- **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they adhere to a common interface or inherit from a common base class.

- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods within a class. It hides the internal implementation details and provides controlled access to the object's attributes and methods.

## Directory Structure

The directory is organized as follows:

```
/
├── examples/
│   ├── example1.py
│   ├── example2.py
│   └── ...
├── exercises/
│   ├── exercise1.py
│   ├── exercise2.py
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

- The `examples` directory contains Python files that demonstrate various concepts related to classes and objects. These examples serve as a reference to understand the concepts and their implementation.

- The `exercises` directory contains Python files with exercise prompts. Each exercise focuses on a specific topic or concept related to classes and objects. You can solve the exercises to practice and reinforce your understanding.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.

2. Navigate to the repository's directory.

3. Explore the `examples` directory to study the provided code examples and gain a better understanding of the concepts.

4. Solve the exercises in the `exercises` directory. Each exercise file contains a prompt and placeholders for your code. Replace the placeholders with your solutions.

5. Test your solutions by running the exercise files using Python. You can execute the command `python3 exercise1.py` (replace `exercise1.py` with the exercise file you want to run).

6. Repeat steps 4-5 for each exercise in the `exercises` directory until
