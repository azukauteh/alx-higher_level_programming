# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

This directory contains the code solutions for the project "0x07. Python - Test-driven development" alx_africa School curriculum.

## Description
The project focuses on the concept of test-driven development (TDD) in Python. It involves writing tests before implementing the actual code to ensure that the code meets the specified requirements.

## Files
The project consists of the following files:

- `0-add_integer.py`: Contains a function that adds two integers.
- `0-add_integer.txt`: Text file containing the doctest for the `0-add_integer.py` file.
- `2-matrix_divided.py`: Contains a function that divides all elements of a matrix by a given divisor.
- `2-matrix_divided.txt`: Text file containing the doctest for the `2-matrix_divided.py` file.
- `3-say_my_name.py`: Contains a function that prints a person's name.
- `3-say_my_name.txt`: Text file containing the doctest for the `3-say_my_name.py` file.
- `4-print_square.py`: Contains a function that prints a square using the `#` character.
- `4-print_square.txt`: Text file containing the doctest for the `4-print_square.py` file.
- `5-text_indentation.py`: Contains a function that indents a given text.
- `5-text_indentation.txt`: Text file containing the doctest for the `5-text_indentation.py` file.

## Requirements
The code in this project is written in Python 3. The files have been tested and verified to work correctly in a Python 3 environment.

## Usage
To test the functions in each file, you can run the corresponding doctest. For example, to test the `0-add_integer.py` file, run the following command:

```
python3 -m doctest -v ./0-add_integer.txt
```

Make sure to replace `0-add_integer.txt` with the respective file name for each function.
